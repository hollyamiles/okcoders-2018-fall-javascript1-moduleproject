                On a too warm October Friday, I hopped on a plane in toasty OKC.  I wore jeans, a t-shirt and flip flops, but I had boots and socks in my bag. Raincoat was stashed in the outside pocket, ready to be utilized the moment I step foot outside of PDX, of course.    
              </p>
              <p>
                I nearly ached with anticipation.  Not only to see my best friends and spend uninterrupted time with them, but to be transported home.  Home is my cool, green state that was decidedly slower-paced, especially during the rainy season.  The nearly constant gray drizzle has created lush forests with pine needle carpets that gave just so when you walked across them. 
              </p>
              <p>
                My agenda was sparse, time with friends, eat as much good food as possible, drink local wine (of course), and hike.  Likely a city hike so time wouldn't be lost to travel since this was a quick trip.  3 days only.  Just enough time to soak up all things Pacific Northwest, but with minimal impact to my measly PTO balance and not too much time away from Hunter and August. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Friday: touchdown in PDX at 6pm.  Cade picked me up and whisked me off to my favorite sushi restaurant, Bamboo.  Channa and Steph were waiting, having already battled traffic from Salem and Vancouver, respectively. Bliss, absolute bliss.  The wine was flowing, the food was amazing and everyone was bubbly with excitement after being reunited after 2 months since our California camping trip in August this summer. Can't beat that.
              </p>
              <p>
                Saturday: Slept in! (That never happens with a toddler at home!) Leisurely breakfast at Steph's and then off to Mt. Tabor.  Easy, fast hike with a gazillion coffee shops nearby. Then over to Channa's to see her family (Vivian is getting SO big!) and see progress on the basement remodel.  So much fun.  We wander up to Fremont street and get in line for Pip's doughnuts.  It's Saturday, in Portland... of course there is a line, but they move quickly and those little doughnuts are so worth it.  I order the lavender chai, too. We decide on dinner.  Back to an old favorite, Over & Out.  I can almost taste the Acai Margarita!  After dinner, we go back to Steph's and hang in the living room with a fire and pinot from Dominio IV.  It's the end to a perfect day. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Sunday: Breakfast with the gang before my flight home.  Definitely needing a greasy spoon sort of place, but still needing something quintessentially Portland. Gateway Breakfast House it is.  Back to my old stomping grounds.  Food coma, here I come.  I want the works: eggs, hash browns, bacon and pancakes.  I'm about to roll onto a plane and sleep for the 2+ hours to my quick layover in Denver, where I can be sensible and get a salad or something, but for now let me indulge during my last few moments at home.  Until next time, Portland!
